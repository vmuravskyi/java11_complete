/*
 * ArrayList and LinkedList both implement the List interface.
 * Create a method that accepts a list of 'Number' (the superclass of number classes in Java).
 * The method should add items to the start of the list, using add(0, *some number*)
 * Make the method at a large number of items, e.g. 100,000
 * Using System.currentTimeMillis(), time how long it takes to add all the numbers.
 * Try your method with an ArrayList, and with a LinkedList
