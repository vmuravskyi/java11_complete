/*
 * Create a generic class that can store objects of any type.
 * 
 * The class should use an internal array to store the objects.
 * The size of the internal array should be specified by the constructor.
 * 
 * The class should have add(), get() and size() methods.
 * 
 * The add() method accepts an object to add, and may be called
 * as many times as is desired.
 * 
 * The get() method accepts an index and returns the item at the given
 * index in the array.
 * 
 * The size() method returns the number of items presently in the internal array.
 * 
 * If more items are added than can be fitted in the array,
 * the class starts overwriting items at the start of the array.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * Internal buffer of size 3.
 * 
 * First three items are stored at indexes 0-2.
 * 
 * Fourth item overwrites item at index 0
 * Fifth item overwrites item at index 1
 * etc.
